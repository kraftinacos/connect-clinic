                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p>No, you don't need a referral to see us. You can book directly through our website. However, if you have a regular GP, we recommend letting them know you're seeking mental health support, as they can be involved in your ongoing care if needed.</p>

                    <p>All our consultations are conducted via secure video call. Once your booking is confirmed, you'll receive a link to join the video session at your appointment time. You'll need a device with a camera and microphone (computer, tablet, or smartphone) and a stable internet connection. We use encrypted, HIPAA-compliant platforms to ensure your privacy.</p>

                    <p>Yes, our psychiatrists can prescribe medication when clinically appropriate. For ongoing prescriptions, you'll need a GP who can continue prescribing under our guidance. If you don't have a GP, we can provide guidance on finding one.</p>
